    <h3>Army Service</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audie_Murphy"> Audie Murphy</a> served in the U.S. Army during World War II, and became one of the most decorated soldiers at the time. He recieved every U.S. Army combat award, as well as multiple French and Belgian awards, for his heroism. At the Colmer Pocket in France, Murphy single-handedly held off an entire German company with a .50 caliber machine gun and subsequently launched a counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition. These amazing feat became the most famous story about the young soldier, and was what earned him the Medal of Honor.</p>
    <p>In addition to his service in Europe, Murphy served in the Mediterranean Theater. It was in Morocco that Murphy was inserted into the war. While in Morocco and Algeria the 3rd Infantry Division, to which Murphy was assigned, conducted rigorous training in preparation for the Allied assault landings in Sicily. After the 3rd ID swept across Sicily, they prepared for another assualt on mainland Italy. A few months after the mainland invasion, Murphy was awarded his first award for heroism, a Bronze Star with "V" device, for single-handedly eliminating a German tank and its crew with rifle grenades after crawling out from cover to close with the enemy. During his next few months of operations in Italy, Murphy earned the Combat Infantry Badge and a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Bronze Star.</p>
    <p>After the successes in Italy, the 3rd ID invaded southern France. Murphy earned the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions during the first wave of this invasion. Throughout the duration of his unit's operations in France, Murphy earned various other awards for his heroism. As mentioned above, his most famous feat was at the Colmar Pocket in the Vosges Mountains. While under heavy German fire, Murphy ordered his subordinates to retreat to a safer position in the woodline. However, he remained in place to direct allied artillery fire on German positions via radio and held off an advancing German company with his M1 carbine and a .50 caliber machine gun mounted to a burning vehicle. He maintained this defense for an hour before rejoining his men to launch a counterattack. Finally on 16 February 1945, Staff Sergeant Murphy was promoted to First Liutenant, awarded the Legion of Merit, and moved away from the front lines. For his exemplary heroism, the U.S. Army dedicated an award in his honor, the Sergeant Audie Murphy Award, which can be awarded to exceptional Noncommissioned Officers.</p>
